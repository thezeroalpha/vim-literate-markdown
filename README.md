# vim-literate-markdown
This is a Vim plugin that attempts to replicate a subset of the features of Emacs' Org mode code handling.
So for example, tangling the code from the current file, or executing blocks of code.
Except it's for Markdown files, not for Org.
Markdown is a much more universal syntax in my opinion.

This plugin is a work in progress and far from complete.
For more information about its features, see doc/literate-markdown.txt.
