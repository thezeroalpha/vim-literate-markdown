# vim-literate-markdown
This is a Vim plugin that attempts to replicate a subset of the features of Emacs' org mode code handling.
So for example, tangling the code from the current file or executing blocks of code.
Except for Markdown files, not for Org.
Markdown is a much more universal syntax.

This plugin is a work in progress and far from complete, it's semi-functional but I would not recommend using it yet.
Also there is no documentation at the moment.
